   	<h2>What is the blockchain?</h2>
    <p>The blockchain is a database that is shared between the nodes of a computer network. This database stores information in a digital format. The most popular role of the blockchain is their crucial role within the cryptocurrency systems such as etherum or bitcoin for keeping a secure and decentralized record of all transactions. The great thing about the blockchain is that it guarantees the security of a record of data and creates trust without the need for a third party. </p>
   <h2> How the blockchain is different from typical databases</h2>
	<p>One of the key differences between the blockchain and a regular typical database is how the data is structured. The block chain collects information together in groups which are called blocks that hold information. These blocks have certain storage capacities and when they are filled, they are closed which then link the previously filled block that creates a chain hence the name. </p>
<h2>Key Points</h2>
    <ul>
	 <li>Blockchain is a shared database that stores data in blocks that are linked together with cryptography</li>
	 <li>Once new data comes in, it is put into a fresh block and chained together once filled</li>
     <li>Lots of different types of information can be stored on the blockchain but the most common are ledgers for transactions</li>
     <li>Decentralized blockchains are immutable which means that all data that is entered cannot be deleted and are permanently recorded.</li>
     <li>No singular person has control of the block chain, the control is held in all users.</li>
	</ul>
