   	<h2>What are NFTs?</h2>
    <p>NFT stands for non-fungible token which means it is totally unique and cannot be replaced or replicated
    which means it is 100% one of a kind. Most NFTs are apart of the Ethereum block chain which you can learn
    more about by clicking on the black chain tab on the left.</p>
    <h2>Still confused?</h2>
    <P>Think of it like a one of a kind trading card,but if you traded it for a different card you would have something completely different. </p>
    <h2>An Example</h2>
    <p>Look at the images down below, these are examples of the many popular NFTs, which are sold for up to hundreds of thousands of dollers everyday.
     These particular NFTs below are apart of the bored ape collection which is the most popular type of NFT with some selling for millions of dollers.</p>
